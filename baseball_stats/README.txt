In this project, we analyze the Baseball dataset in order to answer the following question:
 - is there any relatonship between salary and stats? what are the characteristics of the highest paied players?
The final goal is to find the most relevant relationships between salary and performance parameters (statistics) of baseball players.

To do this, we consider the dataset of stats of the American National Baseball League. This dataset contains all the performance statistics of the players from the year 1875 up to 2014.
