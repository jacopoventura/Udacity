If the name is not in the list, we save it in a dictionary of wrong names where the key is the wrong street name and value the list of full wrong names. We create a new dictionary that maps the wrong names (key) to the correct name (value). Using this map, we correct the street names.\n",

    "This analysis showed that the OSM file is incomplete and several errors are present. The main issue found was the presence of nodes that are not part of the city of Mestre. For example, many nodes and ways that are located in others nearby small cities are included in Mestre's OSM. Other errors like typos can be be corrected by auditing the XML file as we did in this project. \n",

    "However, the dataset should be improved consistently in order to provide useful and complete information. The poorest part was the information about doctors, which is an important information for locals and tourists. For this reason, it would be beneficial to use third party sites like ulss12.it, which is the official healthcare website of the area, to include these info. Since Mestre is part of the City of Venice, more information about public transportations to and from Venice should be provided. Also in this case, third party website like actv.it (official public transportaton website) should be used to create new tags for the bus stop nodes. Info about restaurants and museums can be retrieved from Google Maps, whereas info about hotels can be obtained from booking.com. However, a lot of coding has to be done in order to automatically access these info from website's API. To ensure the correct format of data, the codes developed in this project can be employed."
